# Start a CanvasUI Implementation Session

Use one of these prompts to begin a new session with an AI agent:

## Standard Prompt (Recommended)

> Continue implementing CanvasUI. Follow the `/implement-layer` workflow. Read `PROGRESS.md` for current state, `PRD.md` for deliverables, and `SPEC.md` for the specification. Complete all remaining sub-items in the current layer, ensure typechecking and linting pass, then stop for my review.

## Abbreviated Prompt

> /implement-layer

## After Approving a Review

> The current layer is approved. Update `PROGRESS.md` and proceed to the next layer following `/implement-layer`.

## To Request Changes

> I have feedback on the current layer before approving. [describe changes]. Fix these, re-run tests, and re-submit for review.
