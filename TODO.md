* Add new Layer 1.1 - "Geometry"
  - Create efficient and fundamental geometry primitives
    - Point
    - Vector (support Polar and Cartesian coordinates)
    - Ray (origin and direction)
    - Line
    - Rectangle
    - Circle
    - Ellipse
    - Polygon (open and closed)
    - Arc
    - Bezier Curve
    - Quadratic Curve
    - Path
  - The primitives should be able to be used both in isolation, and as part of a scene graph (nesting, interaction)
    - This means that the primitives should be able to be transformed, nested, and interacted with if part of a scene, otherwise the can be constructed and nested outside of a scene for geometric calculations
  - All shapes should support parametric point along shape interpolation
  - All primitives should support via superclass:
    - Nesting (shapes transforms should be applied to nested shapes)
    - Transform (same as Element)
    - Find distance from given point to shape
    - Find closest point on shape to given point
    - Intersection with line
    - Intersection with other shapes
    - Area
    - Perimeter
    - Bounding box
    - Centroid (readonly)
  - All geometric operations should consider nested transforms to form a global space when point testing
  - Create Layer 1.1 Demo
    - Show all shapes
    - Use Ticker to draw line from 0,0 in Scene through to pointer location, highlight all shapes that the line intersects
    - For each shape, highlight the closest point on the shape to the pointer
    - For each shape, highlight the area of the shapes
    - Bound a circle around the scene edges, highlight all shapes that the circle intersects as well as points of intersection
