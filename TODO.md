* Create new Layer 9.1 Demo - "Interaction Scale"
  - Use a slider to define number of random elements
  - Create random elements with random positions, sizes, and colors
  - Attach hover and press events to change color by tinting
  - Add a button to reset the demo
* Add new Layer 1.1 - "Geometry"
  - Create efficient and fundamental geometry primitives
    - Point
    - Vector (support Polar and Cartesian coordinates)
    - Line
    - Rectangle
    - Circle
    - Ellipse
    - Polygon
    - Arc
    - Bezier Curve
    - Quadratic Curve
    - Path
  - All primitives should support via superclass:
    - Nesting
    - Transform
    - Parametric point along shape interpolation
    - Distance from point to shape
    - Closest point on shape
    - Intersection with line
    - Intersection with other shapes
    - Area
    - Perimeter
    - Bounding box
    - Centroid
  - All primitives should be able to be rendered by the renderer
  - All primitives should be able to be hit tested by the hit tester
  - Create Layer 1.1 Demo
